# Wind Turbine Economics

App for estimating cost, profitability and return on investment of wind farm developments.

## Description

For a single turbine, the app calculates:

* Net Annual Energy Production
* Levelized Replacement Cost
* Yearly Revenue
* Operations & Maintenance Cost
* Land Lease Cost
* Cost of Power Generation
* Total Annual Expense (cost of sales)
* Annual Profit (gross margin)
* Return on Investment Ratio
* Break-Even point in years

For larger wind farm devlopments, the app calculates:

* Levelized Cost of Energy
* Annual Energy Production
* Production Days Equivalent
* Fixed Charge Rate
* Levelized Fixed Cost
* Levelized Variable Cost
* Margin
